/**
 * Component â€” discrete, reusable UI elements.
 *
 * Components should not be responsible for their positioning or layout within
 * the site. Never apply widths or heights except to elements that natively have
 * these properties (e.g. images have these properties, so it's okay to use CSS
 * to modify their width and height). Within components, separate structural
 * rules from stylistic rules.
