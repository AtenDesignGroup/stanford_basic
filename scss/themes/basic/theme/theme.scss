 * 5. Theme — purely visual styling (“look-and-feel”) for a component.

 * Purely visual styling, such as border, box-shadow, colors and backgrounds,
 * font properties, etc. Ideally, these should be separated enough from a
 * component’s structure to be “swappable”, and omitting these entirely should
 * not break the component’s functionality or basic usability.
